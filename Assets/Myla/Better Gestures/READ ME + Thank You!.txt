Thank You so much and i hope you enjoy the Better Gesture Animations i made!

I purely made it because my index broke and using backup vive controllers, i absolutely hate how the normal gestures look like in comparison to the index ones so i made new and better ones.
However i thought i would make it for everyone who doesnt have index as well to have gestures that sort of look like you have, instead of having the default ugly gestures that look all spread out and weird.

Please recommend a friend you know who doesnt like how the normal gestures look on the fingers so both you and them can have way better looking gestures!
